# Stock Sentiment Analysis using News Headlines (Introduction)
In this project we will be creating a model that will be able to predict the movement of the stock based on the news headlines, 
here we are using a dataset taken from www.kaggle.com, it was scrapped from Yahoo finance website for a period of 16 years (2000-16).
It consists of top 25 news headlines for each row in the dataset.

The feature 'label' is 
- 1 - when the stock price increased
- 0 - when stock price remained same or decreased
